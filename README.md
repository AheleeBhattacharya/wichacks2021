Inspiration
The trans and non-gender conforming community is largely not understood by those not in the community. With this game we wanted to educate people on some of the issues these people face on a daily basis and bring light to some of the hardships they face. That's how the game lets the users put themselves in the shoes of non-gender conforming community and lets them understand the issue, so that the users would definitely think twice before making anyone feel low. Everyone should respect each creations of the nature and stop criticising.

What it does
This is a choose your own adventure style game where you can choose which dialogue the main character says, and what actions they do.

How we built it
We created the game using a software called Ren'Py (which uses python and its own 'language'). For the website we used bootstrap and general html and css.
